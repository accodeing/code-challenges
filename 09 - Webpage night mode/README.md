# Webpage night mode

This weeks challenge is simple to explain: create a nightmode switch for a web page.

We are using Jonas' page from last week. You should be able to toggle the night mode on and off.

## Theme detection

There are also functions in the browser to detect if the user is running a light
or dark theme in their OS.

Use these to detect which and default the site to the users preference.
