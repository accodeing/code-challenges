# Hello WASM!

In any language you like write a hello world style WASM program that works like this:

A JS/HTML page that collects a name, sends the name to the WASM binary and gets a greeting string back from WASM that is then displayed on the page.

So for example a form where the user types "World!", that gets sent to WASM and the string "Hello World!" is returned from WASM and displayed on the page.
