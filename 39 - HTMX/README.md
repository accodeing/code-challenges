# TODO

In the classical webapp "hello world" example, we are going to build a TODO app using HTMX. Use the provided server as a starting point and add as much of the normal TODO list functionality that you have time for.

Use the [HTMX docs](https://htmx.org/) as a reference and utilise as many of the features as you can.

To run the server, from the root of the project run: `yarn node index.js`
