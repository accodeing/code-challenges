# CSS @layer

Let's practice the use of the CSS at-rule `@layer`.
The website found in `starter/` is built and styled, by ChatGPT, using Bootstrap and Popper.
Your task is to redesign it with new style rules in `main.css` using `@layer`.
Keep the bootstrap classes and styles and just add an extra layer of your own styles above
the styles from Boostrap. You can see the expected result for the desktop version in `finished.jpg`.
If you have time, you can also make a mobile version or style the modal which opens if you press the "Read more" button.
