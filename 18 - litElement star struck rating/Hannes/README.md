# \<heimr-star-struck-rating\>

litElement version of the star struck rating component. Builds on last weeks starstruck component.

This did not go well. There are a lot of concepts that I need to learn about in litElement. I even had trouble building with rollup... So nothing to see from this weeks challenge.
