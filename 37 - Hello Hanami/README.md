# Hello Hanami!
It's time for us to get to know the Ruby framework [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/) better.

Your task is to create a "Hello World" application in Hanami 2.0. Use the [Hanami 2.0 tempalate](https://github.com/hanami/hanami-2-application-template) and play along :)

## Short introduction to Hanami 2.0
The current stable version of Hanami is version 1.3, which the [documentation](https://guides.hanamirb.org/) covers.
We are not interested in that version, but the next major version 2.0. They call it a "start fresh", which means more or less a total rewrite from scratch.
Version 2.0 is heavily dependent on [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/) as well as [Ruby Object Mapper](https://rom-rb.org/).
Note that Hanami 2.0 is still under construction, so be careful to check the date of what you read. You can find the [latest release notes here](https://hanamirb.org/blog/).
