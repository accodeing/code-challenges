# Data structures

A collection of code challenges for data structures.

Implement in any language you like, but only using primitive language constructs. You are not allowed to use external libraries to achieve the solution, obviously.

## 1. Tree

Construct a representation of a tree structure using and method. The tree will be used for searching for strings. You get strings to be inserted and have to build a tree that allows you to tell if a string exists in the tree or not, like for a keyword search.

The data we are inserting is:

 * foment
 * highbrow
 * erratic
 * extricable
 * ascertain
 * tangential
 * contentious
 * talon
 * valiant
 * aseptic
