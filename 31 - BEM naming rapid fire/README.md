# BEM naming rapid fire

In the starter folder is a collection of small BEM naming focused exercises.
Each of task is around how to name the elements in the example. It might just be
an HTML skeleton, it might already have class namnes that you need to update or
it might already be BEMified, but maybe not so good ...

Copy the starter folder under your own name and go through as many of the files
as you can in 30 minutes. Good luck!
