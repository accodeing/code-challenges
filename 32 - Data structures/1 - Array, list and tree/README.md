# Array

The array structure should hold the entire tree in a single array, the array should only contain the actual data values. You will need helper functions to manipulate the array.

    [DATA1,DATA2,...,DATAN]

# Linked list

A list is a set of cells that contain a value and one or more references to the next cell. In this case as well you will need to create helper functions to manage the list.

    [DATA1,P1,P2,...,PN][DATA2,P1,P2,...,PN] ... [DATAN,P1,P2,...,PN]

# Tree object

This is a fully contained object structure, it holds the data and any methods needed to manipulate it.

    tree = new Tree();
    nodeA = tree.insert("A");
    nodeAA = nodeA.insert("AA");
    ...
    nodeN = nodeN-1.insert("ACC");

Or something like that ...
