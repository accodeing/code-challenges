# Your mission
![Finished design](./finished.jpg)

Create this design in as many ways as possible. That is, using as many ways to layout the page as you can. The design doesn't have to be 100% pixel perfect, the goal is to find different ways to achieve the same result.

# Structure

Say you want to create a new layout based on CSS Grid. Copy the starter into your folder under a descriptive name, like `grid`. Edit index.html and main.css to achive the layout.

When you feel you are done you can start again wit a new copy of the starter for the next attempt.

When you are done you should have added something like this to the repo:

```text
Jonas/
  grid/
    index.html
    css/
      main.css
      base.css
    img/
      finished.jpg
      logo.png
      ...
  flex/
    index.html
    css/
      main.css
      base.css
    img/
      finished.jpg
      logo.png
      ...
  ...
```

and so on...

Good luck.
