# Accodeing Coding Challenges

In this repo we store our in house coding challenges. Doing coding challenges is a great way to kickstart the week and an oppertunity to quickly delve into problem solving.

Each challenge has different rules and restraints and serve different purpouses.

* Each friday someone sets up a new challenge for the coming week. 
* A challenge can be between 30 minutes and 5 days long.
* The language used can be set or be left to each participant to decide.
* A challenge is not a competition.
* The gain is in trying to find the sollution and sharing your experience rather than the sollutions themselves.
