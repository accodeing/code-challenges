# Accodeing Coding Challenges

In this repo we store our in house coding challenges. Doing coding challenges is a great way to kickstart the week and an oppertunity to quickly delve into problem solving.

Each challenge has different rules and restraints and serve different purpouses.

- Each friday someone sets up a new challenge for the coming week.
- A challenge can be between 30 minutes and 5 days long.
- The language used can be set or be left to each participant to decide.
- A challenge is not a competition.
- The gain is in trying to find the solution and sharing your experience rather than the sollutions themselves.
