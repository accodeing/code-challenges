# Christmas greetings

The animated christmas card is looking lovely, but isn't really christmasy.

Clone the starter and replace the current animation with a nice snowy winter
scene with falling snow.

You can opt to make it really simple and just do one layer of falling flakes, or
spice it up using different layers and a nice parallax effect. Maybe the snow
just falls off of the bottom of the screen, but it doesn't have to.

Start with the falling snow and make it your own!
